== programcreek-osgi

The JDT examples presented in this project use operations (search index, Built-in AST Rewrite, â€¦) that require a Workspace.

If a Workspace can be created programmatically and doesn't need to fire up the Eclipse UI, it requires an OSGi runtime.
The `org.eclipse.core.runtime` services have to be available (the Workspace code in `org.eclipse.core.resources` rely on those).

NOTE: The Workspace location is driven by the `osgi.instance.area` property.

For OSGi the proposed solution relies on the link:https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/tree/master/maven/bnd-maven-plugin[maven bnd plugins]. This make the pom file more complex than for plain java projects.

To execute the tests in an IDE, be sure to run them inside an OSGi container (in the same way the maven build is doing it).
If you are using Eclipse IDE, consider installing link:https://bndtools.org/[bndtools].
IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate seems also to have support for OSGi.
